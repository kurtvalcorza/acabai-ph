## 🎯 Our Mission: Democratize AI for Every Filipino

The Philippines has immense talent and world-class creativity. Yet, for too long, our innovators have been stalled by limited access to powerful AI tools. High costs, a persistent digital divide, and siloed efforts have held back our nation's potential.

## Your Launchpad for AI Innovation

ACABAI-PH is our strategic response. We are building the national launchpad for Filipino AI innovation, providing the infrastructure, tools, and collaborative environment needed to turn brilliant ideas into high-impact solutions. Our goal is to ensure that the next world-changing innovation doesn't stay grounded, but achieves escape velocity to benefit every corner of the archipelago.

### Nexus for Artificial Intelligence Research and Application (DOST-NAIRA)

Think of us as the mission control for the Philippines' AI ambitions. We are creating a sovereign "AI-as-a-Service" platform—an automated factory for AI development that empowers innovators to focus on their mission, not on building the rocket.

By providing centralized access to high-performance computing, curated datasets, and expert guidance, we are removing the friction that has traditionally slowed down AI development. DOST-NAIRA is where government, academe, and industry converge to build the tools that will design our nation's future.

### Democratized Intelligent Model Exchange Repository (DIMER)

**Democratizing AI—One Model at a Time**

DIMER is the Philippines’ first open repository of AI models, created to make machine learning accessible to those with limited resources. It provides ready-to-use AI models trained on local datasets, APIs, and datasets across strategic sectors.
- **Disaster Resilience:** Rapidly identify landslide-affected zones from satellite imagery
- **Urban Planning:** Analyze traffic flow with models that understand our unique mix of vehicles
- **Food Security:** Accelerate the mapping of every rice field in the country to safeguard our food supply

### iTANONG: Leveraging NLP for Inclusive Data Access

**May gusto ka bang iTANONG?**

Most valuable data is locked away in complex databases or lengthy documents. iTANONG breaks down these barriers. It is a homegrown AI solution that empowers any Filipino to access information through natural language queries in English, Tagalog, or Taglish.

Using advanced Text-to-SQL and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, iTANONG provides a secure, internal intelligence tool that grounds its answers in your verified data. It's about putting the power of data directly into the hands of decision-makers, frontline workers, and citizens—no technical skills required.
