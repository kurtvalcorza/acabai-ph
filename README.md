# Advancing Computing, Analytics, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence for the Philippines

## Our Mission: Democratizing AI for Every Filipino

The Philippines has immense talent and world-class creativity. Yet, for too long, our innovators have been stalled by limited access to the powerful tools of Artificial Intelligence. High costs, a persistent digital divide, and siloed efforts have held back our nation's potential.

## Your Launchpad for AI Innovation

ACABAI-PH is our strategic response. We are building the national launchpad for Filipino AI innovation, providing the infrastructure, tools, and collaborative environment needed to turn brilliant ideas into high-impact solutions. Our goal is to ensure that the next world-changing innovation doesn't stay grounded, but achieves escape velocity to benefit every corner of the archipelago.

### Nexus for Artificial Intelligence Research and Application (DOST-NAIRA)

Think of us as the mission control for the Philippines' AI ambitions. We are creating a sovereign "AI-as-a-Service" platform—an automated factory for AI development that empowers innovators to focus on their mission, not on building the rocket.

By providing centralized access to high-performance computing, curated datasets, and expert guidance, we are removing the friction that has traditionally slowed down AI development. DOST-NAIRA is where government, academe, and industry converge to build the tools that will design our nation's future.

### Democratized Intelligent Model Exchange Repository (DIMER)
